# 5G_Caching_Simulator

This is a caching simulator designed to work with 5G networks. It allows you to test various caching algorithms and configurations to optimize network performance.

## Features

- Supports various caching algorithms such as LRU, LFU, and Random
- Allows you to specify the cache size and eviction policy
- Supports simulation of different network conditions
- Provides real-time statistics on cache hit and miss rates, as well as network latency and throughput

## Getting Started

To get started with the 5G Caching Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Configure the simulator parameters such as cache size, eviction policy, and network conditions
4. Run the simulator and analyze the results

## Usage

Here is an example of how to run the simulator:
